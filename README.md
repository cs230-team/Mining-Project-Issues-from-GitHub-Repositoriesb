This project contains the code and results for Automatic Classification of Bug Fix Patterns For Bug Fix Mining

The folders are structured as follows:


Bug Cluster - Contains code for analyzing clusters generated by the Fix Miner tool

BugAID -> contains a fork for the BugAID tool along with the scripts written for data extraction, cluster data and analysis.

ChangeDistiller -> contains code and data for generating Change Distiller diffs

fuzzy-cluster -> contains code and data for fuzzy clusters generated from change distiller diffs

seq_mining -> contains code and data for patterns obtained by sequence mining.

We have done pair programming in the following aspects to try and run all these tools on the chosen datasets to extract clusters:
Pooja -Soundarya- running fix-miner tool for defects4j, clustering of bugs based on ChangeDistiller change types. 
Rupa - Soundarya -running fix-miner tool for defects4j, clustering of bugs based on ChangeDistiller change types. 
Jaspreet- Running BugAid tool for BugsJS and itâ€™s cluster analysis, found bugsjson, defects4j, general research
Soundarya-dataset identification, related work
Anurag - wrote script for clustering, of FixMiner based on Defects4j patterns
Swati- Wrote script to convert Defects4J bug-fixes to format required by SPMF data mining. Ran PrefixSpan and BIDE algorithm to find fix-patterns using sequential pattern mining
